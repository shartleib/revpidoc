|Number of digital output channels
|14

|Output type
|Galvanically isolated from the system bus and the inputs, individually configurable as direct digital output with high-side or push-pull drivers as well as a PWM output. 3Maximum current per output 500 mA (high-side mode), 100 mA (push-pull mode) doublefootnote:[ The PWM pulse width is stored as a value from 0 to 100 in the process image in 1 byte. The maximum resolution of the conversion of this value in % by the module depends on the PWM frequency: 40 Hz / 1%, 80 Hz / 2%, 160 Hz / 4%, 200 Hz / 5%, 400 Hz / 10%.]
